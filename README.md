This project is aimed at exploring Weaviate  database search, using Cohere to generate custom vectors.
There are several searches we perform using the steps listed below:
- RAG single prompt
- vector search

You will need the following:
- a Weaviate API Key and URL
- a cohere API Key

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. create a .env file and stor your creds
3. test the db connection by running: `python database/open_db_connection`
4. create a embeddings for the dataset: `python database/create_embeddings`
- this will create a new directory inside your root directory called 'scratch.'
- it will then create a .csv file that contains all of the vectors generated by Cohere
5. create a new collection in your Weaviate instance: `python database/create_collection`
- this will create a new collection called "MovieCustomVector"
6. import the data: `python database/import_data`
7. query the data: `python -m queries.{the_file_you_wish_to_query}`
8. to terminate the db connection for any reason: `python database/close_db_connection`
